- Include practical exercises for each concept

## File Naming Convention

- Use kebab-case
- Format: `{methodology}-{topic}.mdx`
- Examples:
  - `scrum-fundamentals.mdx`
  - `scrum-roles.mdx`
  - `scrum-ceremonies.mdx`

## Review Process

- Methodology expert review

- Scaling patterns across methodologies
- Cultural impact assessments
- Transformation guidelines
- Metrics and success indicators

Note: Tool-specific guides (Jira, Asana, GitHub Projects, etc.) will be documented separately in a dedicated "Tools and Implementation" section.

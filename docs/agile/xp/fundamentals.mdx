```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="background" label="Historical Context" default>
    **Development**: - Created by Kent Beck in the 1990s - Refined during
    Chrysler C3 project - Formalized in "Extreme Programming Explained" (1999)
    **Evolution**: - Response to traditional waterfall limitations - Focus on
    technical excellence - Integration with Agile movement
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="motivation" label="Key Motivations">
    **Drivers**: - Need for faster delivery - Adapting to changing requirements
    - Improving software quality - Enhancing team collaboration **Goals**: -
    Reduce development cycles - Increase customer satisfaction - Improve code
    quality - Enable continuous feedback
  </TabItem>

## Core Values

:::info Foundation
XP is built on five fundamental values that guide all practices and decisions.
:::

### 1. Communication

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="principles" label="Key Principles" default>
    **Focus Areas**: - Face-to-face interaction - Continuous dialogue - Team
    collaboration - Knowledge sharing **Implementation**: - Daily stand-ups -
    Pair programming - Team workspace - Customer involvement
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="benefits" label="Benefits">
    **Outcomes**: - Faster problem solving - Reduced documentation needs -
    Better team alignment - Improved decision making
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Simplicity

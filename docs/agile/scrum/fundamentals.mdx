    A --> C[Inspection]
    A --> D[Adaptation]
    B --> E[Shared Understanding]
    C --> F[Regular Reviews]
    D --> G[Continuous Improvement]
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="transparency" label="Transparency" default>
    **Definition**: Making significant aspects of the process visible to those responsible for the outcome.

    **Key Aspects**:
    - Common language
    - Shared definition of "Done"
    - Open access to artifacts
    - Visible progress tracking

    **Implementation**:
    - Information radiators
    - Daily stand-ups
    - Sprint reviews
    - Burndown charts
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="inspection" label="Inspection">
    **Definition**: Regular examination of artifacts and progress toward goals.

    **Key Aspects**:
    - Timely reviews

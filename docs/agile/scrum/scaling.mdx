  root((Scaling Drivers))
    Product Complexity
      Multiple Components
      Technical Dependencies
      Integration Needs
    Organizational Growth
      Multiple Teams
      Geographic Distribution
      Resource Optimization
    Market Demands
      Faster Delivery
      Coordinated Releases
      Customer Needs
```

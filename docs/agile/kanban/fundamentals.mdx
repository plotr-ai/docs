## What is Kanban?

Kanban is a popular framework for implementing Agile and DevOps software development that emphasizes real-time communication, full transparency of work, and continuous flow. The word "Kanban" comes from Japanese, literally translating to "signboard" or "visual signal," reflecting its core principle of visual management.

### Historical Context

:::info Origins
Kanban's roots trace back to the late 1940s when Toyota optimized its engineering processes based on supermarket inventory management systems. Just as supermarkets stock just enough products to meet consumer demand, Toyota applied this "just-in-time" (JIT) principle to match inventory levels with material consumption on their factory floors.

### Key Differences from Other Methodologies

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="scrum" label="vs. Scrum" default>
    **Process Structure**:
    - Kanban: Continuous flow with no prescribed timeboxes
    - Scrum: Fixed-length sprints (usually 2 weeks)

    **Roles & Responsibilities**:
    - Kanban: Flexible roles, no prescribed positions
    - Scrum: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team

    **Change Philosophy**:
    - Kanban: Changes can happen at any time
    - Scrum: Changes during sprint are discouraged

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="traditional" label="vs. Traditional">
    **Work Management**:
    - Kanban: Pull-based, limit WIP
    - Traditional: Push-based, resource utilization focus

    **Planning Approach**:
    - Kanban: Just-in-time, continuous flow
    - Traditional: Comprehensive upfront planning

    **Change Handling**:
    - Kanban: Embraces change, adaptive
    - Traditional: Change control boards, resistance

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Agree to Pursue Incremental Change

:::info Evolution over Revolution
Kanban promotes evolutionary change that's easier to implement and sustain.
:::

1. **Small Changes**

   - Iterative improvements
   - Measurable steps
   - Feedback-driven
   - Risk mitigation

2. **Continuous Evolution**
   - Regular assessment
   - Adaptation cycles
   - Learning loops
   - Progressive enhancement

### Make Process Policies Explicit

```

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that emphasizes flexibility, continuous improvement, and rapid delivery. Unlike traditional waterfall methodologies, Agile enables teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and evolving user needs.

### The Agile Manifesto

:::info Historical Context
The Agile Manifesto was created in 2001 by 17 software developers who met in Snowbird, Utah. They sought to establish lightweight alternatives to documentation-driven software development processes.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="values" label="Core Values" default>
The foundation of Agile is built on four key values:

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a rigid plan

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="principles" label="12 Principles">
    The Agile Manifesto is supported by 12 principles that guide implementation:
    
    1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery
    2. Welcome changing requirements
    3. Frequent delivery of working software
    4. Business and developers working together
    5. Build projects around motivated individuals
    6. Face-to-face conversation
    7. Working software as progress measure
    8. Sustainable development pace
    9. Technical excellence and good design
    10. Simplicity
    11. Self-organizing teams
    12. Regular reflection and adaptation
  </TabItem>

### Benefits of Agile

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="delivery" label="Delivery Benefits" default>
    - **Faster Time to Market**: Regular releases enable early and continuous
    delivery - **Better Quality**: Regular testing and integration improve
    overall quality - **Predictable Costs**: Fixed-length iterations help manage
    budgets
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="team" label="Team Benefits">
    - **Enhanced Collaboration**: Cross-functional teams work together closely -
    **Higher Motivation**: Teams have more autonomy and ownership - **Continuous
    Learning**: Regular retrospectives enable improvement
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="business" label="Business Benefits">
    - **Higher Customer Satisfaction**: Customer needs are continuously
    integrated - **Increased Flexibility**: Changes can be implemented quickly -
    **Better ROI**: Value delivery starts earlier in the project
  </TabItem>

### 1. Scrum

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="overview" label="Overview" default>
    Scrum is a structured framework that helps teams manage complex work through
    iterative progress. Key characteristics include:
      - Fixed-length iterations (sprints)
      - Clear roles and responsibilities
      - Regular ceremonies and events
      - Emphasis on empirical process control
      - Focus on continuous improvement
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="when" label="When to Use">
    Best suited for projects that:
      - Have changing requirements
      - Need regular feedback
      - Require incremental delivery
      - Benefit from timeboxed delivery
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Kanban

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="overview" label="Overview" default>
    Kanban is a visual method for managing work as it moves through a process. Core principles include:
      - Visualize the workflow
      - Limit work in progress (WIP)
      - Manage and optimize flow
      - Make process policies explicit
      - Implement feedback loops
      - Improve collaboratively
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="when" label="When to Use">
    Best suited for projects that:
      - Have a stable workflow
      - Need to optimize flow
      - Require visual management
      - Benefit from continuous improvement
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Lean Software Development

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="overview" label="Overview" default>
    Adapted from lean manufacturing principles, Lean Software Development focuses on maximizing value and minimizing waste. Key principles include:
      - Eliminate waste
      - Build quality in
      - Create knowledge
      - Defer commitment
      - Deliver fast
      - Respect people
      - Optimize the whole
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="when" label="When to Use">
    Best suited for projects that:
      - Need to reduce waste
      - Require fast delivery
      - Benefit from continuous improvement
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Extreme Programming (XP)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="overview" label="Overview" default>
    XP emphasizes technical excellence and customer satisfaction through specific engineering practices:
      - Test-driven development
      - Pair programming
      - Continuous integration
